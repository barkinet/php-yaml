php-yaml v0.1.0 through v0.3.0 was developed by [Ryusuke Sekiyama](http://d.hatena.ne.jp/rsky/20071228/1198841055).

Starting with v0.4.0 the extension has been maintained by Bryan Davis with
support from [Keynetics Inc](http://keynetics.com). Special thanks to Brad and Tim for being executives who understand that giving back to the open source community is important.

Inspiration and some implementation details have been taken from:
  * php-syck http://pecl.php.net/package/syck
  * [MacRuby](http://www.macruby.org/)'s [libyaml wrapper](http://www.macruby.org/trac/browser/MacRuby/trunk/ext/libyaml)
  * LibYAML's examples http://pyyaml.org/wiki/LibYAML
