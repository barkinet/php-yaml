FUTURE FEATURES
===============

Document parse callback syntax and usage.
Document merge support.
Document new ini settings for emit.

More tests for proper string emits
tests for yaml_parse_file
tests for yaml_parse_url
tests for yaml_emit_file

Add some sort of callback support for emitting objects. Hashtable keyed on
classname? Callback would be responsible for transforming object into
array/scalar data and providing a tag for the resulting serialization.

Add php ini setting to turn y/n boolean treatment on/off.
  see http://www.kuwata-lab.com/materials/php_yaml-0.3.0.patch

Add reference checking in emit so that recursive structures are handled 
corectly. Example:
<?php
  $recurse = array("a" => 1, "b" => 2);
  $recurse["c"] = $recurse;
  var_dump(yaml_emit($recurse));
