FUTURE FEATURES
===============

Document parse callback syntax and usage.

Add php ini setting to turn y/n boolean treatment on/off.
  see http://www.kuwata-lab.com/materials/php_yaml-0.3.0.patch

More tests for proper string emits

Support << "merge" in mappings. Probably means refactoring the parser so that
we retain more information about mapping keys.

Add some sort of callback support for emitting objects. Hashtable keyed on
classname? Callback would be responsible for transforming object into
array/scalar data and providing a tag for the resulting serialization.
