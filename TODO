FUTURE FEATURES
===============

Document parse callback syntax and usage.
Document merge support.

More tests for proper string emits
tests for yaml_parse_file
tests for yaml_parse_url
tests for yaml_emit_file
tests for parse callbacks

Add some sort of callback support for emitting objects. Hashtable keyed on
classname? Callback would be responsible for transforming object into
array/scalar data and providing a tag for the resulting serialization.

Add php ini setting to turn y/n boolean treatment on/off.
